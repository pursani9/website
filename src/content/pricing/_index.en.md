  p1: "Pay as you play. A few hours of new music a day costs less than a streaming service.

  As you replay, the cost goes up, and you own a track once you’ve paid about $1.40.

  Stream from your collection for free, forever."

  p2: "Make many times more than the norm, and at least a penny on every stream.

  Cash out after about $11 in earnings.

  Get a 70% cut for artists and rights-holders.

  <small>The other 30% goes back into the co-op. Profits are shared among members, including artists.</small>

  Or release for free, if that’s your thing."

  p3: "Pay 1/4 of a penny the first time you play, then a little more each time you replay.

  Then it’s yours forever."

        Of that, musicians/rights holders get 70% with 30% going to pay for the platform and writer royalties. Resonate pays artists/rights holders out as soon as they’ve earnt 10€ on the platform.

        Stream2own makes for a better relationship between listeners and artists, where they can find representative reward from those who value their music and build a trusted relationship with listeners who will be their advocates.

        With subscription streaming, artists are forced into a new form of digital servitude as listeners would have to stream a song hundreds of times to equal the price of a single download.    

        To listen, you just buy credit (5, 10, 20€) and stream or buy now.

        Our members, who are are artists and listeners, and our owners, are currently discussing future plans and ideas for new ways to pay, listen and enjoy art on Resonate. Including pay what you want, direct fan support for artists, collective and high streamer subscription offers. Watch this space and contribute your ideas via the topic in the [forum](https://community.resonate.is).

        To do this, Resonate is testing a kind of decentralized membership or ‘Community Credentials’ that allows co-op memberships, special purchases and simple agreements between Members to be validated without exposing the private data of the people involved. 

        A system like this could allow members of one co-op or service to be recognized by others without personal information being exposed or stored in centralized databases.

    - text: "**Resonate is building these privacy- respecting validation tools** to help co-operatives work together."
      details: |-
        We imagine a future with many life supporting services provided by different co-ops sharing this kind of safe authentication. 

        For example, an artist might earn credit when their song plays in a co-op coffee shop. Then they could exchange their music earnings as credits for food at a co-op store, or rehearsal space at a land trust, or other services at a time bank in their neighborhood. 

        By connecting co-ops together in this way, more and more people might have the opportunity to use spaces and services that are democratically-owned and managed. We might begin to inhabit a completely ‘co-operative lifestyle’ without the online tracking and data profiling common today.
